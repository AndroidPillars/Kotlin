- It runs on JVM and can be used anywhere Java is used today. 
- It can be used to develop Android apps, server-side apps and much more.
- Kotlin was developed by JetBrains team.

# Kotlin Data Type

- Data type refers to type and size of data associated with variables and functions.

__Variable__

- Variable refers to a memory location. 
- It is used to store data. 
- The data of variable can be changed and reused depending on condition or on information passed to the program.
- Kotlin is a statically typed language, which makes it different from the dynamically typed JavaScript.
- We don't require specifying the type of variable explicitly.
```ruby
var name ="Android"  
val age = 10  
```
- We can also explicitly specify the type of variable while declaring it.
```ruby
var name: String ="Android"  
val age: Int = 10
```
- var (Mutable variable) -> We can change the value of variable declared using var keyword later in the program.
- val (Immutable variable) -> We cannot change the value of variable which is declared using val keyword.
