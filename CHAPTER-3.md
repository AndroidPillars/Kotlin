# Object Orientation in Kotlin

- Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology of designing a program using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

# Classes

- A template (blueprint) for creating objects (the real thing).

```ruby
class MainActivity {

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {

        val mMicrophone = Microphone()

    }
}
```
